Cross-disciplinary collaborative attempts at national or regional levels have been used to define future research priorities, founded on detailed archaeological baseline studies. In some cases, such studies have provided a mechanism for regional assessment of submerged landscapes. In 2009 the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Belgium collaborated on a research and management framework for the submerged archaeology of the Southern North Sea (Peeters et al. ), which was recently updated for the Netherlands section (Peeters et al. ). Occasional calls have been made to develop similar Archaeological Research Frameworks for Australia (Iacono ; Schacht ) but they have yet to be produced. The Submerged Prehistoric Archaeology and Landscapes of the Continental Shelf (SPLASHCOS) Network in Europe was funded by the European Science Foundation through their Cooperation in Science and Technology Trans-Domain Framework (TD-902), and was designed to facilitate the communication and formation of a European-wide network of researchers, policy makers, managers and industrial partners, specifically devoted to the archaeology of submerged landscapes. This has led to a series of national baseline studies and the integration of data in an online viewer (see the various contributions in Bailey et al. ).","This article arises from research funded by the Northern Territory Government and we would like to acknowledge the support of the Northern Territory Heritage Branch and funding provided through the Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018 (Cwlth).",,,,,,,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113879576

I thank Vincent Copley senior?s nephew, Vincent Branson, who participated in the fieldwork and Ngadjuri cultural advisor Quenten Agius who assisted with site recording. Kylie Lower was invaluable in the field. The majority of the petroglyphs were recorded in 2014 by students from Flinders University, enrolled in ARCH3312 Rock Art Field School and ARCH8809 Indigenous Australian Archaeology Field School. I thank all of them for their enthusiasm and sharp eyes and Matthew (Frank) Boulden, in particular, for the original identification and early tracings of the sailing ship image. The archival research presented in Table 1 was undertaken by Matthew Ebbs. Antoinette Hennessy prepared the digital tracings and many of the figures presented in this paper. The three-dimensional modelling in Figure 1 was created by Kylie Lower using data collected by Nicu Christi and Andrei Asandulesei, who joined us in the field from Iasi University, Romania. Emma Davey suggested some of the background readings. I am grateful to RAR reviewers Robert Bednarik, Liam Brady and Jordan Ralph for allowing me to incorporate their comments into the text of this paper. Gary Jackson al-ways challenges my thinking and proffers viable alternatives to some of my most cherished interpretations.

National research funding programs include the National Science Foundation in the USA, the Australian Research Council, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in Canada, or the Ministry of Economy and competitiveness in Spain. Think also in terms of federal programs aimed at promoting cultural heritage. Potential funders here include the Wenner-Gren Foundation (), the National Geographic Society (), the Getty Foundation (), and the European Union (European Commission ). Often countries have reciprocal agreements and these can be a source of project funding. The most notable example here is the Fulbright program (Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs ), which operates in 78 countries. Groups such as Earthwatch () have an interest in archaeological and cultural projects and can help organize groups of volunteers to help with surveys and excavations.
