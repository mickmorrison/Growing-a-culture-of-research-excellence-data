National research funding programs include the National Science Foundation in the USA, the Australian Research Council, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in Canada, or the Ministry of Economy and competitiveness in Spain. Think also in terms of federal programs aimed at promoting cultural heritage. Potential funders here include the Wenner-Gren Foundation (), the National Geographic Society (), the Getty Foundation (), and the European Union (European Commission ). Often countries have reciprocal agreements and these can be a source of project funding. The most notable example here is the Fulbright program (Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs ), which operates in 78 countries. Groups such as Earthwatch () have an interest in archaeological and cultural projects and can help organize groups of volunteers to help with surveys and excavations.
