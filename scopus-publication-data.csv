Often countries have reciprocal agreements and these can be a source of project funding. The most notable example here is the Fulbright program (Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs ), which operates in 78 countries. Groups such as Earthwatch () have an interest in archaeological and cultural projects and can help organize groups of volunteers to help with surveys and excavations. However, in return you have to be prepared to ‘entertain’ volunteers with after-hours talks and slideshows.",,,,,,,,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942502451

Cross-disciplinary collaborative attempts at national or regional levels have been used to define future research priorities, founded on detailed archaeological baseline studies. In some cases, such studies have provided a mechanism for regional assessment of submerged landscapes. In 2009 the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Belgium collaborated on a research and management framework for the submerged archaeology of the Southern North Sea (Peeters et al. ), which was recently updated for the Netherlands section (Peeters et al. ). Occasional calls have been made to develop similar Archaeological Research Frameworks for Australia (Iacono ; Schacht ) but they have yet to be produced. The Submerged Prehistoric Archaeology and Landscapes of the Continental Shelf (SPLASHCOS) Network in Europe was funded by the European Science Foundation through their Cooperation in Science and Technology Trans-Domain Framework (TD-902), and was designed to facilitate the communication and formation of a European-wide network of researchers, policy makers, managers and industrial partners, specifically devoted to the archaeology of submerged landscapes. This has led to a series of national baseline studies and the integration of data in an online viewer (see the various contributions in Bailey et al. ).","This article arises from research funded by the Northern Territory Government and we would like to acknowledge the support of the Northern Territory Heritage Branch and funding provided through the Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018 (Cwlth).",,,,,,,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113879576
