Heinemann, widely respected senior Traditional Owners of Ndrua’ngaith and Nggoth lands and who sadly passed away during this research. We are grateful to them and other Traditional Owners for generously sharing their time and knowledge with us. We also thank Beatrice Gordon, Stanley Coconut, Ivy Gordon, Florence Hector, Suzie Madua, Robert Madua and Nicholas Heinemann for working with us. This research has been partially funded by a grant from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (G2007/7266) and we thank them for their support. Data on culturally modified trees has largely been obtained through Rio Tinto Alcan cultural heritage management projects between 2003–2008 and we acknowledge the hard work of Eleanor Cooper, Alex Walter, Amanda Woodley, Lavinia Kris, Nicky Horsfall, Grant Cochrane and Richard Woolfe. We also thank Cameo Dalley for bringing to our attention the Nelson collection at the University of Queensland as well as Annie Clarke and a second anonymous referee whose comments on an earlier draft have greatly improved the final product.

The research presented here would not have been possible were it not for a National Science Foundation East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes Award to Shepard (2011, Award 1107910) and we sincerely thank them for their support. A considerable proportion of the CMT data analysed here were collected during field work undertaken between 2004-2008 and commissioned by local mining companies, most notably Rio Tinto-Alcan. Research and heritage management work since 2008 has been supported by the Indigenous Heritage Program (Grants 2009-61689; 2011-71668) and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (Grant 2007-7266). We also thank Quan Hua (ANSTO) for advice with regards to CMT dating. We take responsibility for any errors of fact or logic in this paper and unless otherwise acknowledged the ideas and arguments presented here are our own.

N1  - Funding text 1: To be successful you will also have to think nationally. National research funding programs include the National Science Foundation in the USA, the Australian Research Council, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in Canada, or the Ministry of Economy and competitiveness in Spain. Think also in terms of federal programs aimed at promoting cultural heritage. Potential funders here include the Wenner-Gren Foundation (), the National Geographic Society (), the Getty Foundation (), and the European Union (European Commission ). Often countries have reciprocal agreements and these can be a source of project funding. The most notable example here is the Fulbright program (Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs ), which operates in 78 countries. Groups such as Earthwatch () have an interest in archaeological and cultural projects and can help organize groups of volunteers to help with surveys and excavations. However, in return you have to be prepared to ‘entertain’ volunteers with after-hours talks and slideshows.

N1  - Funding text 1: This is measured by three indicators: international to domestic student ratio, international to domestic staff ratio and the proportion of research that involves international collaboration. These criteria provide a higher weighting for universities with a high number of international students, staff and collaborations. A university seeking to increase its position in the Times Rankings is incentivised to increase its international staff and student numbers. Employing international staff over national candidates decreases the likelihood of Australian archaeology graduates being employed in academic institutions in their home country. The COVID-19 crisis has also revealed the folly of universities being financially dependent on overseas students, with the humanities also impacted by an intended decrease in financial support from the Australian government (Australian Academy of Humanities ).

N1  - Funding text 1: Archaeological Research Frameworks are another mechanism used to evaluate regional potential, and studies of this nature have been undertaken in parts of Europe. Cross-disciplinary collaborative attempts at national or regional levels have been used to define future research priorities, founded on detailed archaeological baseline studies. In some cases, such studies have provided a mechanism for regional assessment of submerged landscapes. In 2009 the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Belgium collaborated on a research and management framework for the submerged archaeology of the Southern North Sea (Peeters et al. ), which was recently updated for the Netherlands section (Peeters et al. ). Occasional calls have been made to develop similar Archaeological Research Frameworks for Australia (Iacono ; Schacht ) but they have yet to be produced. The Submerged Prehistoric Archaeology and Landscapes of the Continental Shelf (SPLASHCOS) Network in Europe was funded by the European Science Foundation through their Cooperation in Science and Technology Trans-Domain Framework (TD-902), and was designed to facilitate the communication and formation of a European-wide network of researchers, policy makers, managers and industrial partners, specifically devoted to the archaeology of submerged landscapes. This has led to a series of national baseline studies and the integration of data in an online viewer (see the various contributions in Bailey et al. ).

I thank the many Ngadjuri people who supported my research with them over the last 23 years, especially Ngadjuri Elder Vincent Copley senior and his son Vincent Copley junior. The ideas for this paper are informed by our conversations over the many years we have worked together. I thank Vincent Copley senior?s nephew, Vincent Branson, who participated in the fieldwork and Ngadjuri cultural advisor Quenten Agius who assisted with site recording. Kylie Lower was invaluable in the field. The majority of the petroglyphs were recorded in 2014 by students from Flinders University, enrolled in ARCH3312 Rock Art Field School and ARCH8809 Indigenous Australian Archaeology Field School. I thank all of them for their enthusiasm and sharp eyes and Matthew (Frank) Boulden, in particular, for the original identification and early tracings of the sailing ship image. The archival research presented in Table 1 was undertaken by Matthew Ebbs. Antoinette Hennessy prepared the digital tracings and many of the figures presented in this paper. The three-dimensional modelling in Figure 1 was created by Kylie Lower using data collected by Nicu Christi and Andrei Asandulesei, who joined us in the field from Iasi University, Romania. Emma Davey suggested some of the background readings. I am grateful to RAR reviewers Robert Bednarik, Liam Brady and Jordan Ralph for allowing me to incorporate their comments into the text of this paper. Gary Jackson al-ways challenges my thinking and proffers viable alternatives to some of my most cherished interpretations. In addition, for this paper, he encouraged me to move beyond my default position of co-authorship to write a sole authored paper. I am grateful for his support and our animated discussions.

N1  - Funding text 1: Unfortunately, based on your comments, there was not a shred of evidence  … The article is yet another example of FAKE NEWS. This is in part supported by your comments based upon your own preconceived ideas. This FAKE NEWS is promulgated by ‘journalists’  … who unfortunately have their own agenda. It is very poor science, to draw conclusions without evidence  … Your work is not science, it is an attempt to distort and taint history. Find some evidence to support your claims, or better still and more importantly, use the science of archaeology for what it is intended—to ascertain the truth.

David Pumpa provided access to the Baker’s Flat artifact collection, and Dale Hampel provided access to the Baker’s Flat site. The cemetery research was supported by the Irish Group at the South Australian Genealogical and Historical Society, the Christchurch Anglican Parish, the Clare Historical Society, Martin Smith from the Mintaro Historical Society, Pat and Mary Connell (the Navan Catholic Cemetery caretakers), and the Riverton Historical Society. Fr. Mark Sexton, Northern Light Catholic Parish, provided support to all three projects. Kelsey Lowe undertook the geophysical survey of Baker’s Flat, assisted by Lynley Wallis, Jordan Ralph, and Susan Arthure. Claire Smith, Penny Crook, and two anonymous referees provided helpful and insightful feedback that has enhanced this paper.
