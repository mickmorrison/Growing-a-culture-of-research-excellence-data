N1  - Funding text 1: We would like to thank the Derwent Valley Council for hosting us each year in New Norfolk and the many people of the New Norfolk community who shared their thoughts about, and visions for, the Royal Derwent Hospital site. We particularly thank Haydn and Penny Pearce for kindly providing access to the Ladies? Cottage collection. At the University of Canberra Alison Wain co-supervised the original thesis on which this paper is based. At Flinders University Lynley Wallis, Chantal Wight and the students of ARCH8807 helped to catalogue the original collection. Michelle Newton-Edwards provided practical conservation advice and Justin Halstead assisted with the conservation process and speculated on the enigma of the Ladies? Cottage aprons. We also thank the two anonymous reviewers for their insightful and encouraging comments.

David Pumpa provided access to the Baker’s Flat artifact collection, and Dale Hampel provided access to the Baker’s Flat site. The cemetery research was supported by the Irish Group at the South Australian Genealogical and Historical Society, the Christchurch Anglican Parish, the Clare Historical Society, Martin Smith from the Mintaro Historical Society, Pat and Mary Connell (the Navan Catholic Cemetery caretakers), and the Riverton Historical Society. Fr. Mark Sexton, Northern Light Catholic Parish, provided support to all three projects. Kelsey Lowe undertook the geophysical survey of Baker’s Flat, assisted by Lynley Wallis, Jordan Ralph, and Susan Arthure. Claire Smith, Penny Crook, and two anonymous referees provided helpful and insightful feedback that has enhanced this paper.

The research presented here would not have been possible were it not for a National Science Foundation East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes Award to Shepard (2011, Award 1107910) and we sincerely thank them for their support. A considerable proportion of the CMT data analysed here were collected during field work undertaken between 2004-2008 and commissioned by local mining companies, most notably Rio Tinto-Alcan. Research and heritage management work since 2008 has been supported by the Indigenous Heritage Program (Grants 2009-61689; 2011-71668) and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (Grant 2007-7266).

N1  - Funding text 1: Acknowledgments This article is dedicated to the memory of Mrs T. Coconut and Mrs A. Heinemann, widely respected senior Traditional Owners of Ndrua’ngaith and Nggoth lands and who sadly passed away during this research. We are grateful to them and other Traditional Owners for generously sharing their time and knowledge with us. We also thank Beatrice Gordon, Stanley Coconut, Ivy Gordon, Florence Hector, Suzie Madua, Robert Madua and Nicholas Heinemann for working with us. This research has been partially funded by a grant from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (G2007/7266) and we thank them for their support. Data on culturally modified trees has largely been obtained through Rio Tinto Alcan cultural heritage management projects between 2003–2008 and we acknowledge the hard work of Eleanor Cooper, Alex Walter, Amanda Woodley, Lavinia Kris, Nicky Horsfall, Grant Cochrane and Richard Woolfe. We also thank Cameo Dalley for bringing to our attention the Nelson collection at the University of Queensland as well as Annie Clarke and a second anonymous referee whose comments on an earlier draft have greatly improved the final product.

This is the first time that the assemblages have been assessed together. The South Australian Museum (SAM) facilitated access to these artefact collections and the work was supported by the Far West Coast Aboriginal Corporation.

N1  - Funding text 1: This is measured by three indicators: international to domestic student ratio, international to domestic staff ratio and the proportion of research that involves international collaboration. These criteria provide a higher weighting for universities with a high number of international students, staff and collaborations. A university seeking to increase its position in the Times Rankings is incentivised to increase its international staff and student numbers. Employing international staff over national candidates decreases the likelihood of Australian archaeology graduates being employed in academic institutions in their home country. The COVID-19 crisis has also revealed the folly of universities being financially dependent on overseas students, with the humanities also impacted by an intended decrease in financial support from the Australian government (Australian Academy of Humanities ).

N1  - Funding text 1: To be successful you will also have to think nationally. National research funding programs include the National Science Foundation in the USA, the Australian Research Council, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in Canada, or the Ministry of Economy and competitiveness in Spain. Think also in terms of federal programs aimed at promoting cultural heritage. Potential funders here include the Wenner-Gren Foundation (), the National Geographic Society (), the Getty Foundation (), and the European Union (European Commission ). Often countries have reciprocal agreements and these can be a source of project funding. The most notable example here is the Fulbright program (Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs ), which operates in 78 countries. Groups such as Earthwatch () have an interest in archaeological and cultural projects and can help organize groups of volunteers to help with surveys and excavations. However, in return you have to be prepared to ‘entertain’ volunteers with after-hours talks and slideshows.

N1  - Funding text 1: This research has resulted from a series of Australian Research Council grants [DP0877463, LP0882985, DP160101832 and FL160100123]. The Northern Territory Government Department of Lands Planning and the Environment and Dr John Kearney also provided some funding between ARC grants. The authors are indebted to the Lamilami family for permission and assistance with field research that underpins this paper, especially Patrick Lamilami (also known as Cecil Namunidjbuk) and Leonard Lamilami. Many volunteers, students and colleagues assisted with this research over a ten-year period, too many to list individually but their contributions are greatly appreciated. Janet and Phil Davill deserve special recognition as they volunteered a great deal of time and energy throughout this period, along with Wayne Brennan, Michelle Langley and Irina Ponomareva. For Awunbarna research we are indebted to Traditional Owner Charlie Mungulda. The authors also thank Lee and Dianne Davidson, Ray Curry, Bridget Adams (nee Thomson), Scott Adams, the rest of Davidson?s Arnhemland Safaris? staff and research student Roxanne Tsang. Thanks to Injalak Arts and Benson Nagurrgurrba for discussing the cultural significance of the back-to-back figures with us. The authors thank the Northern Land Council for access and research permits. Griffith University, Linnaeus University, Monash University, The Australian National University, ICREA and the University of Barcelona are thanked for supporting this research.
