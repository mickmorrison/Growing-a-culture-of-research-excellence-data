N1  - Funding text 1: We would like to thank the Derwent Valley Council for hosting us each year in New Norfolk and the many people of the New Norfolk community who shared their thoughts about, and visions for, the Royal Derwent Hospital site. We particularly thank Haydn and Penny Pearce for kindly providing access to the Ladies? Cottage collection. At the University of Canberra Alison Wain co-supervised the original thesis on which this paper is based. At Flinders University Lynley Wallis, Chantal Wight and the students of ARCH8807 helped to catalogue the original collection. Michelle Newton-Edwards provided practical conservation advice and Justin Halstead assisted with the conservation process and speculated on the enigma of the Ladies? Cottage aprons. We also thank the two anonymous reviewers for their insightful and encouraging comments.

David Pumpa provided access to the Baker’s Flat artifact collection, and Dale Hampel provided access to the Baker’s Flat site. The cemetery research was supported by the Irish Group at the South Australian Genealogical and Historical Society, the Christchurch Anglican Parish, the Clare Historical Society, Martin Smith from the Mintaro Historical Society, Pat and Mary Connell (the Navan Catholic Cemetery caretakers), and the Riverton Historical Society. Fr. Mark Sexton, Northern Light Catholic Parish, provided support to all three projects. Kelsey Lowe undertook the geophysical survey of Baker’s Flat, assisted by Lynley Wallis, Jordan Ralph, and Susan Arthure. Claire Smith, Penny Crook, and two anonymous referees provided helpful and insightful feedback that has enhanced this paper.

N1  - Funding text 1: The impetus behind this review was a conference paper presented by the author at the Australian Archaeological Association's (AAA) 2014 annual meeting in Cairns, in Australia's tropical north. I should like to extend my deep gratitude to Robin Torrence, whose enthusiasm for that paper spurred me on to write this review and conceive the idea for the Geoarchaeology in the Humid Tropics Special Issue. Special thanks go to Paul Goldberg for many fruitful and enjoyable discussions concerning the philosophy of dirt and other more or less pertinent topics. I would also like to thank Bert Roberts and the rest of the research group at the Centre for Archaeological Science, University of Wollongong, for providing the fertile academic environment in which this review was propagated; and to the Australian Research Council (ARC) for providing the funding support (Australian Laureate Fellowship [FL130100116] to Richard ?Bert? Roberts, the University of Wollongong) for our project. Matthew Tocheri and Alex Mackay kindly commented on early drafts of this paper, and discussions with Conor Mcadams and Ben Marwick did much to focus certain elements of the manuscript. Finally I thank Ania Kotarba-Morley for astute editorial advice and high-quality substantive comments on key aspects of the research.

N1  - Funding text 1: This is measured by three indicators: international to domestic student ratio, international to domestic staff ratio and the proportion of research that involves international collaboration. These criteria provide a higher weighting for universities with a high number of international students, staff and collaborations. A university seeking to increase its position in the Times Rankings is incentivised to increase its international staff and student numbers. Employing international staff over national candidates decreases the likelihood of Australian archaeology graduates being employed in academic institutions in their home country. The COVID-19 crisis has also revealed the folly of universities being financially dependent on overseas students, with the humanities also impacted by an intended decrease in financial support from the Australian government (Australian Academy of Humanities ).

N1  - Funding text 1: To be successful you will also have to think nationally. National research funding programs include the National Science Foundation in the USA, the Australian Research Council, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in Canada, or the Ministry of Economy and competitiveness in Spain. Think also in terms of federal programs aimed at promoting cultural heritage. Potential funders here include the Wenner-Gren Foundation (), the National Geographic Society (), the Getty Foundation (), and the European Union (European Commission ). Often countries have reciprocal agreements and these can be a source of project funding. The most notable example here is the Fulbright program (Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs ), which operates in 78 countries. Groups such as Earthwatch () have an interest in archaeological and cultural projects and can help organize groups of volunteers to help with surveys and excavations. However, in return you have to be prepared to ‘entertain’ volunteers with after-hours talks and slideshows.
